#### Structuring the HTML
I approached structuring the website on a desktop-first basis, prioritizing how the website will look on desktop/computers first. Remembering how a document simply looks like in my head, I couple the contents that would likely be grouped similarly together and put them in sections with appropriate class names to call them easily when I start styling the webpage.

When designing for mobile, I would hide certain elements based on the priorities of the contents I want to show the user. This eliminates the distraction and lets the user maintain the purpose of visiting the website. We also don't want the user to keep scrolling for a long time since it is very inconvenient. We want to assume that when the user opens the website, they want to see the thing they are searching for immediately.

## Lesson Learned
In this case, I feel like I should have approached making the website in a **mobile-first** approach since in our age of tech now, people just tend to search something quickly using their mobile devices when they need something which would fit the use case for this one. In this way too, I would be able to prioritize things that are necessary for users to see in the first place instead of getting distracted with styling the page for desktop view.
